# Learn Redux

A simple React + Redux implementation. This will be turned into a 
ee video series once the app is totally fleshed out.

## Running

First `npm install` to grab all the necessary dependencies. 

Then run `npm start` and open <localhost:7770> in your browser.

## Production Build

Run `npm build` to create a distro folder and a bundle.js file.

## Using external API's for your Redux Stores

You can consider:

* [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk)
* [Redux Saga](https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga)
* [Normalizr (for nested data relationships)](https://github.com/paularmstrong/normalizr)
